# Progress

## What Works
1. Project Structure
   - Basic directory layout established
   - Core dependencies installed
   - Development environment configured

2. Documentation
   - Memory Bank initialized
   - Core documentation files created
   - Project structure documented

3. Development Environment
   - Node.js runtime configured
   - npm package management set up
   - Git version control initialized
   - VSCode IDE configured

4. System Monitoring
   - Real-time CPU and RAM monitoring implemented
   - Socket.IO integration for live updates
   - Chart.js visualization for metrics
   - Responsive dashboard with TailwindCSS
   - System metrics collection with Node.js os module

## What's Left to Build
1. Core Features
   - [To be defined based on requirements]
   - API endpoints
   - Database integration
   - Authentication system
   - Frontend components

2. Infrastructure
   - Testing framework
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Logging system
   - Error tracking

3. Documentation
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Development guides
   - Deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Current Status
1. Project Phase
   - Initial setup
   - Documentation
   - Planning
   - Basic monitoring implemented

2. Development Status
   - Environment ready
   - Structure established
   - System monitoring active
   - Ready for feature implementation

3. Documentation Status
   - Memory Bank initialized
   - Core documentation created
   - Ready for feature documentation

## Known Issues
1. Project Definition
   - Requirements need to be defined
   - Scope needs to be clarified
   - Features need to be prioritized

2. Technical Debt
   - Testing infrastructure needed
   - CI/CD pipeline needed
   - Logging system needed

3. Documentation Gaps
   - API documentation needed
   - User guides needed
   - Development guides needed

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Initial Setup
   - Node.js chosen as runtime
   - Express.js selected as framework
   - MVC architecture adopted
   - Vercel chosen for deployment

2. Development Approach
   - Documentation-first methodology
   - Modular architecture
   - Clean code principles
   - Test-driven development planned

3. Monitoring Implementation
   - Socket.IO for real-time updates
   - Chart.js for data visualization
   - TailwindCSS for responsive design
   - Node.js os module for system metrics
   - 1-second update interval
   - 20-point data history

4. Future Considerations
   - Scalability requirements
   - Performance optimization
   - Security measures
   - User experience improvements
   - Additional system metrics
   - Historical data storage

## Milestones
1. Completed
   - Project initialization
   - Basic structure setup
   - Documentation framework
   - System monitoring dashboard

2. In Progress
   - Requirements gathering
   - Development workflow setup
   - Feature planning

3. Upcoming
   - Core feature implementation
   - Testing infrastructure
   - Deployment pipeline
   - User documentation
