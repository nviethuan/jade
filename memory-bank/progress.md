   - Test-driven development planned

3. Monitoring Implementation
   - Socket.IO for real-time updates
   - Chart.js for data visualization
   - TailwindCSS for responsive design
   - Node.js os module for system metrics
   - 1-second update interval
   - systeminformation package for accurate RAM metrics
   - RAM Usage Ratio chart for better memory visualization
   - Dark/light theme toggle for improved user experience
   - Theme preference persistence using localStorage

4. Wallet Management
   - MongoDB for data persistence
   - Sortable.js for drag and drop functionality
   - Position field for order tracking
