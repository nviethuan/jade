# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial project setup and documentation
- Establishing project structure and patterns
- Setting up development environment

## Recent Changes
1. Project initialization
   - Basic directory structure created
   - Core dependencies installed
   - Development environment configured

2. Documentation
   - Memory Bank initialization
   - Core documentation files created
   - Project structure documented

## Next Steps
1. Define specific project requirements
2. Set up development workflows
3. Implement core features
4. Establish testing infrastructure
5. Configure deployment pipeline

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. Architecture Decisions
   - Node.js with Express.js framework
   - MVC-like architecture
   - Middleware-based request processing

2. Development Environment
   - VSCode as primary IDE
   - Git for version control
   - npm for package management

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Vercel as deployment platform
   - Environment-based configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline setup

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. Code Organization
   - Feature-based structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular architecture

2. Development Practices
   - Documentation-first approach
   - Clean code principles
   - Test-driven development (to be implemented)

3. Version Control
   - Git-based workflow
   - Branch-based development
   - Regular commits and documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. Initial Setup
   - Project structure established
   - Core dependencies identified
   - Development environment configured

2. Documentation
   - Memory Bank structure created
   - Core documentation files initialized
   - Project patterns documented

3. Next Steps
   - Requirements gathering needed
   - Development workflows to be established
   - Testing infrastructure to be set up

## Current Challenges
1. Project Scope Definition
2. Feature Requirements
3. Testing Strategy
4. Deployment Configuration
5. Performance Optimization

## Recent Discussions
[To be documented as they occur]

## Active Tasks
1. Complete project documentation
2. Set up development workflows
3. Implement core features
4. Configure testing environment
5. Establish deployment pipeline
