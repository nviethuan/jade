# Technical Context

## Technology Stack
1. Runtime Environment
   - Node.js
   - npm (Node Package Manager)

2. Web Framework
   - Express.js

3. Frontend
   - Views directory suggests template-based rendering
   - Public directory for static assets

4. Development Tools
   - VSCode IDE
   - Git for version control
   - Vercel for deployment

## Development Setup
1. Prerequisites
   - Node.js runtime
   - npm package manager
   - Git version control
   - VSCode (recommended)

2. Environment Configuration
   - .env file for environment variables
   - vercel.json for deployment settings

3. Project Structure
