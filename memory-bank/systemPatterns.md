# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
jade/
├── src/           # Core application source code
├── routes/        # API route definitions
├── middlewares/   # Request processing middleware
├── views/         # Frontend view templates
├── public/        # Static assets
└── tools/         # Development and utility tools
```

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Node.js as the runtime environment
2. Express.js as the web framework
3. MVC-like architecture pattern
4. Middleware-based request processing
5. Environment-based configuration

## Design Patterns in Use
1. Middleware Pattern
   - Request processing pipeline
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Error handling
   - Logging

2. Route Handler Pattern
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting

3. MVC Pattern
   - Views for presentation
   - Routes for control
   - Models for data (to be implemented)

## Component Relationships
1. Request Flow
   ```
   Client Request → Middleware → Route Handler → Business Logic → Response
   ```

2. Data Flow
   ```
   Client → API Routes → Controllers → Models → Database
   ```

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. Authentication Flow
2. Data Validation
3. Error Handling
4. Logging System
5. Database Operations

## Security Patterns
1. Environment Variable Management
2. Request Validation
3. Error Handling
4. Authentication/Authorization
5. Data Sanitization

## Performance Patterns
1. Caching Strategy
2. Database Optimization
3. Response Compression
4. Static Asset Delivery
5. Load Balancing

## Testing Patterns
[To be defined based on project requirements]

## Deployment Patterns
1. Vercel Deployment
2. Environment Configuration
3. Build Process
4. CI/CD Pipeline
5. Monitoring and Logging

## Code Organization
1. Feature-based Structure
2. Shared Utilities
3. Configuration Management
4. Type Definitions
5. Documentation
